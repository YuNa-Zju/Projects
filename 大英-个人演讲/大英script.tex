Hello everyone, I'm excited to share some of the delicious food from my hometown.

First, let me introduce fish cakes from Wenzhou. It's interesting because I think there are two types of fish cakes in Wenzhou—one is white, and the other is yellow.

The white ones are lighter in flavor, while the yellow ones have a richer taste. But no matter which type, soy sauce and vinegar are a must.

Made from a fish called "马鲛鱼", fish cakes are definitely a signature dish of Wenzhou.

Although Wenzhou is my hometown, I actually spend more time in Hangzhou than in Wenzhou.

And in Hangzhou, the most famous dish is definitely West Lake Vinegar Fish.

Though I haven’t personally tried this famous dish, my parents have. The first few bites are sweet, but after a while, it gets a bit greasy. Eventually, you start to think about tossing the fish into West Lake itself!
